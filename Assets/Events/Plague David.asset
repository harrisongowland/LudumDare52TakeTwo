  EventName: Plague David
  Description: A sickness has spread through the town. Confined to your chambers,
    you hear tales that many people seem to be showing an immunity to the illness,
    in particular one knight named David. Townsfolk beg for you to send him to deliver
    supplies to the worst of the afflicted.
  ChoiceA: Send David
  ChoiceB: Do Nothing
  PositiveOutcomeDescription: Some days pass, and the sickness appears to be dissipating
    at a good rate. With few casualties, it's safe to assume that the only danger
    your townspeople would've faced is starvation - but you saw to that problem long
    before it surfaced. There are some supplies left over - best to repurpose them
    for the harvest.
  NegativeOutcomeDescription: Oops! Turns out David may not have been immune as the
    court physicians first thought. He'll be fine in due course, but for the meantime,
    he will be unavailable for any duties.
