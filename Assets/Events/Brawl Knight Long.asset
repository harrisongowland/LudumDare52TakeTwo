  EventName: Brawl Knight Long
  Description: 'You are tallying up your resources when suddenly, one of the townsfolk
    bursts into your quarters.

    "My lord!" he says, panting. "The two knights
    stationed at the gate have begun brawling and it seems as though they mean to
    see it through to the end. You have to send someone to stop it now!"'
  ChoiceA: Send an agent to stop the fight
  ChoiceB: Refuse
  PositiveOutcomeDescription: 'Your agent successfully quells the fight, and peace
    is restored, just for a little while.

    Nonetheless, the knights must be punished
    for the commotion they''ve caused - a donation to the harvest would serve well
    to sweep this under the rug.'
  NegativeOutcomeDescription: Despite their best efforts, your agent is unable to
    bring a stop to the brawl. In doing so, they find themselves injured - bed rest
    is on the cards for them this time.
