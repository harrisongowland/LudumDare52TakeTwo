  EventName: No Farm, No Fowl
  Description: 'During your daily inspections, you happen across one of the farmsteads
    in your control. As you approach, you hear a commotion.


    "He''s choking,
    he''s bloody choking!" you hear someone screaming. You run towards the source
    of the fuss, and what you see is unusual.


    On the ground, a chicken is clearly
    choking, while a panicked farmer shakes it. You''re fairly confident that you
    could help out the chicken, as you experienced a similar event in your youth.'
  ChoiceA: Turn the chicken upside down and shake it
  ChoiceB: Leave immediately
  PositiveOutcomeDescription: 'You shake the chicken, and after a while, it lets
    out a loud coughing noise. From its beak shoots a small glass bead.


    The
    farmer flaps his arms in joy "Oh thank you sir, thank you! I don''t have much,
    but please take the glass bead - it might be worth a pretty penny at the market".


    You
    take it to the market, and to your shock, it does have some value - enough for
    one crate of apples. Not bad at all.'
  NegativeOutcomeDescription: 'Despite your best efforts, the chicken croaks it.


    "Ah
    well" the farmer says, shrugging. "I''ll just get another one. Thanks anyway."'
