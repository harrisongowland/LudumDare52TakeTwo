  Description: 'It''s a late night of rrowdiness with your fellow crown servants
    at one of the royal homesteads. It''s not long before the village idiot Bodrick,
    the sneaky, conniving man, is at your table trying to make yet another one of
    his hare-brained bets.


    "Simple game this time, I promise," he says, noticing
    the face you make as he sits down. "All you have to do is guess which one of
    these old farts is going to fall asleep first. Henry over there, or his leathery
    friend Lawrence. If I win, I get something, if you win, I get something back.
    Deal?"


    You know Henry has been drinking since the early hours... is it
    worth your time picking him, or opting out of this game entirely?'
  ChoiceA: Go on then, Henry is sure to be out cold soon.
  ChoiceB: Bore off Bodrick, or you'll be cleaning the washrooms till dawn.
  PositiveOutcomeDescription: 'Minutes feel like hours, as you both stare at Henry
    and Lawrence, waiting for any sign that they''re about to doze off.


    You
    feel yourself drifting off at one point, before it catches your attention: Henry
    is snoring.


    Bodrick swears and curses, reluctantly handing you over some
    coin. This will be great for buying more harvest supplies.'
  NegativeOutcomeDescription: Before the sentence can even finish leaving your mouth,
    you are interrupted by Lawrence's famed deafening snore. Without saying a word,
    you place down some coins on the table and saunter home. Enough mead for one
    night, you think.
