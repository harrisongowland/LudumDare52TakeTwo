  Description: 'You are tasked with picking out a suitable bard for the King''s upcoming
    birthday. You''ve spent your day listening to various auditions - some bad, some
    good, some make you question why you even bother.


    As the day wraps to a
    close and you prepare to return to your quarters, a young bard rushes in. You
    remember them as being vaguely good.


    "I''m sorry, I couldn''t leave without
    pleading that you pick me. I know that I can be the best performer"


    You''re
    tired, and honestly, you just want to pick someone sooner rather than later.
    Memory fails you as to whether the King even likes music. Do you take a chance
    on this bard?'
  ChoiceA: Choose the bard
  ChoiceB: Decline the bard
  PositiveOutcomeDescription: 'You decide to take a chance on this bard - and what
    a great idea it was!


    The King enjoys his birthday celebration massively,
    and notes the particularly unique flair of his music. You are handsomely rewarded
    for providing such a joyous celebration.'
  NegativeOutcomeDescription: 'You decide to take a chance on the bard - not your
    finest hour.


    The performance goes largely unnoticed and the King''s temper
    seems to be raised. You decide to provide tribute to hopefully calm his nerves.'
