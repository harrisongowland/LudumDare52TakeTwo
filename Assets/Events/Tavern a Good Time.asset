  Description: 'After a long day of organizing the next harvest, you unwind at the
    local tavern. After a few drinks, one of the locals approaches you, sloshing
    his beer all over himself in the procees.


    "Oi, you." he says, slurring
    his words and jabbing a dirty finger into your chest. "I don''t like you. You
    smell like shite and you have weird feet."'
  ChoiceA: Offer to buy the man a drink to calm him down
  ChoiceB: Tell him to go away
  PositiveOutcomeDescription: 'Some hours pass, and much mead has been consumed.
    You cannot remember why you were ever angry with this man, your new kindred spirit.
    In the euphoria of the evening, you''ve both arranged to climb a mountain together,
    and he''s to be the godfather of your son, should you ever have one. What was
    his name again?


    He also lets slip that he knows where to find some illegally
    sourced items. In a moment of soberness you note this down, planning to return
    the next morning to seize them for your own use.'
  NegativeOutcomeDescription: '"What do you take me for, a charity case?" The man
    is clearly upset with your generosity.


    A crowd has started to form around
    you now - probably best you leave as fast as possible. So fast in fact, you barely
    notice the deeds to some of your coveted resources dropping from your robes.'
